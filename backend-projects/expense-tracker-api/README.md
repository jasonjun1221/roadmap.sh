# ðŸ’µ Expense Tracker API

An API for an expense tracker application. This API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete expenses. Users should be able to sign up and log in to the application. Each user should have their own set of expenses.

  - Past week
  - Past month
  - Last 3 months
  - Custom (to specify a start and end date of your choosing).
- Add a new expense
- Remove existing expenses
- Update existing expenses

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements
