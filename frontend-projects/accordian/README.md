# ðŸ“± Accordion

An accordion component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding answer or content section will expand while collapsing any previously opened section
- This allows only one section to be open at a time, keeping the UI clean and organized.
- This project will help you practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing responsive design patterns using JavaScript.
